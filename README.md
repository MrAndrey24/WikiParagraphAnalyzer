# WikiParagraphAnalyzer

WikiParagraphAnalyzer is an online tool that uses an application programming interface (API) to retrieve a list of randomly selected paragraphs from Wikipedia articles. The application analyzes these paragraphs to provide useful information about the content of the articles, such as the list of words that begin with the same letter as your first name, the average number of words per paragraph, and the paragraphs with the most and least words.


To handle the data, the application uses data transfer objects (DTOs) that ensure the information is retrieved and processed properly.

In addition, the tool provides a user interface (UI) that presents the results clearly and in an easy-to-understand manner. WikiParagraphAnalyzer is useful for those looking to learn more about consuming external APIs and using them in a project.
